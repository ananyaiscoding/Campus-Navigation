# Campus-Navigation
An interactive campus map built without external APIs. It uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest path routing, Leaflet.js for the map interface, and Google Earth for accurate coordinates, providing precise, efficient navigation with full control over data and functionality.

## Features
- Shortest path navigation using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm  
- Custom campus layout with **Leaflet.js** for an interactive map  
- Accurate location data from **Google Earth**  
- Fully offline solution without external navigation services  
- User-friendly interface for easy route planning

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** â€“ Algorithm implementation  
- **Leaflet.js** â€“ Map design and interaction  
- **Google Earth** â€“ Building coordinates extraction  
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** â€“ Frontend interface design

## Project Structure
```

campus-navigation/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ coordinates.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/campus-navigation.git`

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. Explore the campus map and select buildings to find the shortest route.

## Notes
- No external APIs are used; all data is locally stored.
- Coordinates are manually gathered from Google Earth for accuracy.
- The algorithm is implemented from scratch for educational purposes.
